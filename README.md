This repository holds my implementation of following projects:

1. Lane Detection using Canny edge detection and Hough Transform line detection
2. Traffic sign classifier based on LeNet5 and AlexNet using Keras
3. Predicted steering angle using CNN with visual input to drive in simulation by behavior cloning
4. Camera calibration, lane detection and curvature calcuation
5. Detected vehicles using SVM with HOG features
